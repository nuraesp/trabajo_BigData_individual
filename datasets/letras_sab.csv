Oh, I leave quite an impression
Five feet to be exact
You're wonderin' why half his clothes went missin'
My body's where they're at
Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'
Next to me, one degree of separation
I heard you're back together and if that's true
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
If you want forever, and I bet you do
Just know you'll taste me too
Uh-huh, he pins you down on the carpet
Makes paintings with his tongue (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
He's funny now, all his jokes hit different
Guess who he learned that from
Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'
Next to me, one degree of separation
I heard you're back together and if that's true
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
If you want forever, and I bet you do (I bet you do)
Just know you'll taste me too
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Every time you close your eyes
And feel his lips, you're feelin' mine
And every time you breathe his air
Just know I was already there
You can have him if you like
I've been there, done that once or twice
And singin' 'bout it don't mean I care
Yeah, I know I've been known to share
Well, I heard you're back together and if that's true
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
If you want forever, and I bet you do (I bet you do)
Just know you'll taste me too (taste me too, oh)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you (you, no)
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la) yeah, ah-ah
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
(Please, please, please, don't prove I'm right)
I know I have good judgment, I know I have good taste
It's funny and it's ironic that only I feel that way
I promise 'em that you're different
And everyone makes mistakes, but just don't
I heard that you're an actor, so act like a stand-up guy
Whatever devil's inside you, don't let him out tonight
I tell them it's just your culture
And everyone rolls their eyes, yeah, I know
All I'm asking, baby
Please, please, please
Don't prove I'm right
And please, please, please
Don't bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing
My ego's another
I beg you: Don't embarrass me, motherfucker, ah-oh
Please, please, please (ah-ah-ah)
Well, I have a fun idea, babe (uh-huh): Maybe just stay inside
I know you're craving some fresh air
But the ceiling fan is so nice (it's so nice, right?)
And we could live so happily
If no one knows that you're with me
I'm just kidding, but really (kinda), really, really
Please, please, please (please, don't prove I'm right)
Don't prove I'm right
And please, please, please
Don't bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing (heartbreak is one thing)
My ego's another (ego's another)
I beg you: Don't embarrass me, motherfucker, ah-oh
Please, please, please (ah-ah-ah)
If you wanna go and be stupid
Don't do it in front of me
If you don't wanna cry to my music
Don't make me hate you prolifically
Please, please, please (please)
Please, please, please (please)
Please (please), please (please), please
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
I won't give a fuck about you
Oh-mm
I won't give a fuck about you
Mm
When I love you, I'm sweet like an angel
Drawin' hearts 'round our names and dreamin' of
Writing vows, rocking cradles
Don't mistake my nice for naive
I don't waste a second, I know lots of guys
You do something suspect, this cute ass bye-bye
Like, ooh, baby, you say you really like it being mine
So let me give you some advice
Boy, it's not that complicated
You should stay in my good graces
Or I'll switch it up like that, so fast
'Cause no one's more amazing at turning loving into hatred
Boy, it's not that complicated
You should stay in my good graces
Or I'll switch it up like that (like that), so fast (so fast)
'Cause no one's more amazing at turning loving into hatred
that was cool
(I won't give a fuck about you, I won't give a fuck about you)
(I won't give a fuck about you) yeah
I'll tell the world you finish your chores prematurely
Break my heart, and I swear I'm movin' on
With your favorite athlete
Shoot his shot every night
Want you every second, don't need other guys
You do something sus', kiss my cute ass bye-ye-ye
Boy, it's not that complicated
You should stay in my good graces
Or I'll switch it up like that, so fast
'Cause no one's more amazing (amazing) at turning loving into hatred
Boy, it's not that complicated
You should stay in my good graces
Or I'll switch it up like that (like that), so fast (so fast)
'Cause no one's more amazing at turning loving into hatred
oh, no
(I won't give a fuck about you, I won't give a fuck about you)
(I won't give a fuck about you) oh
No, I won't, I won't give a fuck about you
No, I won't (I won't, I won't, I won't)
No, I won't, I won't give a fuck about you
No, I won't (I won't, I won't, I won't)
I know you're not the sharpest tool in the shed
We had sex, I met your best friends
Then a bird flies by and you forget
I don't hear a word 'til your guilt creeps in
"On a Tuesday, send a soft ""Hey"""
As if you really don't recall the time
We were going right, then you took a left
Left me with a lot of shit to second guess
Guess I'll waste another year on wondering if
If that was casual, then I'm an idiot
I'm looking for an answer in between the lines
Lying to yourself if you think we're fine
You're confused and I'm upset
But we never talk about it
We never talk about it
We never talk about it
All the silence just makes it worse, really
'Cause it leaves you so top of mind for me
All the silence is just your strategy
'Cause it leaves you so top of mind for me
We never talk about how you found God at your ex's house
Always made sure that the phone was face down
Seems like overnight, I'm just the bitch you hate now
We never talk it through
How you guilt-tripped me to open up to you
Then you logged out, leaving me dumbfounded, ooh
We were going right, then you took a left
Left me with a lot of shit to second guess
Guess I'll waste another year on wondering if
If that was casual, then I'm an idiot
I'm looking for an answer in between the lines
Lying to yourself if you think we're fine
You're confused and I'm upset
But we never talk about it (we don't talk about it)
We never talk about it (we don't talk about it)
We never talk about it
We don't talk about it, we don't talk about it
We don't talk about it, we don't talk about it
We never talk about how you found God at your ex's house
Always made sure that the phone was face down
Seems like overnight, I'm just the bitch you hate now
We never talk it through
How you guilt-tripped me to open up to you
Then you logged out, leaving me dumb-founded, ooh
We never talk about it
We never talk about it
We don't talk about it
Talk, talk, talk about it (we never talk about it)
We don't talk about it
We never talk about it
We don't talk about it
We don't talk about it
One, two, a one, two, three
The second I put my head on your chest
She knew she's got a real sixth sense
Now her name comes up once, then it comes up twice
And without her even being here, she's back in your life
Now she's in the same damn city on the same damn night
And you've lost all your common sense
What a coincidence
Uh, na, na, na-na-na-na
Uh, na, na, na-na-na-na
Last week you didn't have any doubts
This week, you're holding space for her tongue in your mouth
Now she's sendin' you some pictures wearin' less and less
Tryna turn the past into the present tense, huh
Suckin' up to all of your mutual friends
And you've lost all your common sense
(You've lost all of your common sense)
The way you told me the truth minus 7% (7%)
What a coincidence, uh
Uh, na, na, na-na-na-na
Uh, na, na, na-na-na-na
Uh, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Uh, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
What a surprise, your phone just died
Your car drove itself from L.A. to her thighs
Palm Springs looks nice, but who's by your side?
Damn it, she looks kinda like the girl you outgrew
At least that's what you said
What a coincidence
Oh wow, you just broke up again
What a coincidence
Uh, na, na, na-na-na-na (coincidence)
Uh, na, na, na-na-na-na (coincidence)
Uh, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na (coincidence)
Uh, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na (coincidence)
I was in a sheer dress the day that we met
We were both in a rush, we talked for a sec
Your friend hit me up, so we could connect
And what are the odds you send me a text?
And now the next thing I know, I'm like
Manifest that you're oversized
I digress, got me scrollin' like
Out of breath, got me going like (ooh)
Who's the cute boy with the white jacket and the thick accent? Like (ooh, ah)
Maybe it's all in my head
But I bet we'd have really good bed chem
How you pick me up, pull 'em down, turn me 'round
Oh, it just makes sense
How you talk so sweet when you're doing bad things
That's bed chem
How you're looking at me, yeah, I know what that means
And I'm obsessed
Are you free next week? I bet we'd have really good
Come right on me, I mean camaraderie
Said you're not in my time zone, but you wanna be
Where art thou? Why not uponeth me?
See it my mind, let's fulfill the prophecy (ooh)
Who's the cute guy with wide blue eyes and the big bad mm? Like (ooh, ah)
I know I sound a bit redundant
But I bet we'd have really good bed chem
How you pick me up, pull 'em down, turn me 'round
Oh, it just makes sense (it just makes sense)
How you talk so sweet when you're doing bad things
That's bed chem (well, that's bed chem)
How you're looking at me, yeah, I know what that means
And I'm obsessed (I'm obsessed)
Are you free next week? I bet we'd have really good bed chem
And I bet we'd both arrive at the same time (bed chem)
And I bet the thermostat's set at six-nine (b-bed c-chem)
And I bet it's even better than in my head (ooh)
How you pick me up, pull 'em down, turn me 'round
Oh, it just makes sense (oh, it just makes sense)
How you talk so sweet when you're doing bad things
That's bed chem (well, that's bad chem)
How you're looking at me, yeah, I know what that means
And I'm obsessed (so obsessed)
Are you free next week? (Are you free next week?)
I bet we'd have really good
Hah (make me go), hah
No, no, no
Hah (make me go), hah
No, no, no, no, no, oh, no, oh
Hah (make me go), hah
No, no, no, ooh
Hah (make me go), hah
Whoo-ooh, oh, daily
(A little fade-out)
Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
I can't relate to desperation
My give-a-fucks are on vacation
And I got this one boy, and he won't stop callin'
When they act this way, I know I got 'em
Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya
Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya
(Yes) I know, I Mountain Dew it for ya
(Yes) that morning coffee, brewed it for ya
(Yes) one touch and I brand-newed it for ya (oh)
Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Holy shit
Is it that sweet? I guess so
I'm working late, 'cause I'm a singer
Oh, he looks so cute wrapped 'round my finger
My twisted humor makes him laugh so often
My honey bee, come and get this pollen
Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya
Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya
(Yes) I know, I Mountain Dew it for ya
(Yes) that morning coffee, brewed it for ya
(Yes) one touch and I brand-newed it for ya (stupid)
Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so (yes)
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso (yes)
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo (yes)
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Is it that sweet? I guess so, uh
That's that me espresso
You're so dumb and poetic
It's just what I fall for, I like the aesthetic
Every self-help book, you've already read it
Cherry pick-lines, like they're words you invented
Gold star for highbrow manipulation
"And ""love everyone""is your favorite quotation"
Try to come off like you're soft and well-spoken
Jack off to lyrics by Leonard Cohen
Don't think you understand
Just 'cause you talk like one doesn't make you a man
You're so sad there's no communication
But baby, you put us in this situation
You're running so fast from the hearts that you're breakin'
Save all your breath for your floor meditation
You're so empathetic, you'd make a great wife
And I promise the mushrooms aren't changing your life
Well, you crashed the car and abandoned the wreckage
Fuck with my head like it's some kind of fetish
Don't think you understand
Just 'cause you act like one doesn't make you a man
Don't think you understand
Just 'cause you leave like one doesn't make you a man
Guess I'll end this life alone
I am not dramatic, these are just the thoughts that pass right through me
All the douchebags in my phone
Play 'em like a slot machine, if they're winnin', I'm just losing
A boy who's jacked and kind
Can't find his ass to save my life
Oh, it's slim pickins
If I can't have the one I love, I guess it's you that I'll be kissin'
Just to get my fixins
Since the good ones are deceased or taken
I'll just keep on moanin' and bitchin'
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Jesus, what's a girl to do?
This boy doesn't even know the difference between there, their, and they are
Yet he's naked in my room
Missin' all the things he's missin', God knows that he isn't livin' large
A boy who's nice that breathes
I swear he's nowhere to be seen
It's slim pickins
If I can't have the one I love, I guess it's you that I'll be kissin'
Just to get my fixings
Since the good ones are deceased or taken
I'll just keep on moanin' and bitchin'
Moaning and bitchin'
Since the good ones call their exes wasted
And since the Lord forgot my gay awakenin'
Then I'll just be here in the kitchen servin' up some moanin' and bitchin'
Mm, ah-ah, mm
Don't have to tell your hot ass a thing
Oh, yeah, you just get it
Whole package, babe, I like the way you fit
God bless your dad's genetics, mm, ah
You make me wanna make you fall in love
Oh, late at night I'm thinkin' 'bout you, ah
Wanna try out my fuzzy pink handcuffs?
Oh, I hear you knockin', baby, come on up
I know you want my touch for life
If you love me right, then who knows?
I might let you make me Juno
You know, I just might let you lock me down tonight
One of me is cute, but two, though?
Give it to me, baby
You make me wanna make you fall in love (oh)
I showed my friends, then we high-fived
Sorry if you feel objectified
Can't help myself, hormones are high
Give me more than just some butterflies (ooh)
You make me wanna make you fall in love
Oh, late at night I'm thinkin' 'bout you, ah
Wanna try out some freaky positions?
Have you ever tried this one?
I know you want my touch for life
If you love me right, then who knows?
I might let you make me Juno
You know, I just might let you lock me down tonight
One of me is cute, but two, though?
Give it to me, baby
You make me wanna make you fall in love
Adore me, hold me and explore me
Mark your territory
Tell me I'm the only, only, only, only one
Adore me, hold me and explore me
I'm so fuckin' horny
Tell me I'm the only, only, only, only one
Oh, I know you want my touch for life
If you love me right, then who knows?
I might let you make me Juno
You know, I just might let you lock me down tonight
One of me is cute, but two, though?
Give it to me, baby
You make me wanna make you fall in love
Don't swear on your mom
That it's the first drink that you've had in like a month
No, don't say it was just
An isolated incident that happened once
There's no need to pretend
I've never seen an ugly truth that I can't bend
To something that looks better
I'm stupid, but I'm clever
Yeah, I can make a shitshow look a whole lot like forever
And ever
You don't have to lie to girls
If they like you, they'll just lie to themselves
Like you, they'll just lie to themselves
You don't have to lie to girls
If they like you, they'll just lie to themselves
Don't I know it better than anyone else?
All of your best excuses
No, they don't stand a chance
Against all the chances I give you
Isn't ideal, but damn
You don't even have to try
Turn you into a good guy
You don't have to lift a finger
It's lucky for you, I'm just like
My mother and my sisters
All my (all my friends)
The girl outside the strip club getting her tarot cards read
We love to read the cold, hard facts and swear they're incorrect
We love to mistake butterflies for cardiac arrest
You don't have to lie to girls
If they like you, they'll just lie to themselves
Like you, they'll just lie to themselves
You don't have (don't have), to lie to girls
If they like you, they'll just lie to themselves
Don't I know it better than anyone else?
Girls will cry and girls will lie, and
Girls will do it 'til they die for you
They'll cry and girls will lie, and
Do it 'til the day they die for you (ooh)
Girls will cry and girls will lie, and (ooh)
Girls will lose their god-damn minds for you
They'll cry and girls will lie, and
Do it 'til the day they die for you
Don't smile because it happened, baby, cry because it's over
Oh, you're supposed to think about me every time you hold her
My heart is heavy now, it's like a hundred pounds
It's falling faster than the way you love to shut me down
I think I need a shower, my friends are taking shots
You think it's happy hour, for me it's not
Don't smile because it happened, baby, cry because it's over
Oh, you're supposed to think about me every time you hold her
Don't smile because it happened, baby, cry because it's over
(I want you to miss me, I want you to miss me)
Oh, you're supposed to think about me every time you hold her
(I want you to miss me, I want you to miss me)
Pour my feelings in the microphone
I stay in and when the girls come home
I want one of them to take my phone, take my phone and lose your number
I don't wanna be tempted
Pick up when you wanna fall back in
You can fake it, but you know I know, know I know (don't)
Don't smile because it happened, baby, cry because it's over
Oh, you're supposed to think about me every time you hold her (ah, mm)
Don't smile because it happened, baby, cry because it's over
(I want you to miss me, I want you to miss me)
Oh, you're supposed to think about me every time you hold her
(I want you to miss me, I want you to miss me)
